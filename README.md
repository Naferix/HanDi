# HanDi
Reimagining simple gestures
## Inspiration
For people without the free range of motion that we take for granted, we wanted to create a tool that will give them back that feeling of freedom. There is an estimated 282,000 people currently living with spinal cord injury and the lack of free upper body function leads to a lot of dependence on others which we hope to minimize with our project to improve their quality of life.
## What it does
The HanDi aims to provide a free range of motion for the user and will function just like any normal hand would. 
## How we built it
Using a mixture of c++ on the backend for the functions and arduino as the conduit for the code to run, and coroplast to create the hand, the HanDi comes together to provide a range of motion 
## Challenges we ran into
RIP Michael's sparkling water. Being online proved to be its own challenge because, as we would like to meet up and work together to work on the HanDi together, the work fell on one of our members to do all of the hard physical labor necessary to make the HanDi.
