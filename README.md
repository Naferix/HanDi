# HanDi - Reimagining simple gestures
![](images/5w3VoJZ.png?raw=true)

## Inspiration
For people without the free range of motion that we take for granted, we wanted to create a tool that will give them back that feeling of freedom. There is an estimated 282,000 people currently living with spinal cord injury and the lack of free upper body function leads to a lot of dependence on others which we hope to minimize with our project to improve their quality of life.
## What it does
The HanDi aims to provide a free range of motion for the user and will function just like any normal hand would. 
## How we built it
Using a mixture of c++ on the backend for the functions and arduino as the conduit for the code to run, and coroplast to create the hand, the HanDi comes together to provide a range of motion.
## Challenges we ran into
Being online is, as always, challenging because, as we would like to meet up and work together to work on the HanDi together we were unable to do so causing the work to fall on only one of our members to do all of the hard physical labor necessary to make the HanDi, while another wrote the code to get the HanDi to actually move.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very happy with the final product. There's so much room for improvement for our future creations and being able to come up with an idea and produce it with our diverse skill set made us happy as we realized how impactful and fun of a project this was.
## What we learned
On the product side, it was extremely difficult coming up with an idea, and hard trying to create our project in a short span of time and determining if we had enough materials in order to actually produce our idea. Since our team was quite brand new to hackathons and diverse in the terms of skillsets we had, we were jumping from idea to ideas. 
## What's next for HanDi
The next evolution is to further build upon HanDi to not only do the mere simple motions that we have made now, but to also include complex motions such as holding chopsticks or picking up objects of various sizes. A possible future to dream of is extending beyond the focus of the upper body limbs and expand to the lower body as well going from HanDi to BoDi.
